# Discord Guard Bot
Anythime bot sees someone is attacking the server, bot detects and prevents it.

# Guards for attack
- Ban limit: Each user has a certain number for ban someone. The number can be changed by the server owner. If a user exceeds the limit, the bot will ban the user except for the user that I told in [whitelisted user topic](#whitelisted-users)
- Kick limt: Works the same way as the ban limit, but it tracks the number of kicks instead.
- Bot guard:

# Whitelisted Users
